## What it does? 
 
Concierge AI connects to a user's Pinterest, analyses all of a user's pins, runs them through a Machine Learning Vision API (Google), identifies the landmarks and their coordinates, finds the city and country of those coordinates of each landmarks, ranks the cities/countries to discovers the user's most popular places that they want to see - and then searches Skyscanner's API for the perfect flight, and presents a link to book.
